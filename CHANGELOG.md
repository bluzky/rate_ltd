## [Unreleased]

### Changed - BREAKING
- **Major Architecture Improvement**: Switched to caller-side execution model
  - QueueProcessor now signals callers to execute instead of executing functions itself
  - Eliminates function serialization overhead
  - Provides better performance and natural concurrency
  - Functions no longer stored in Redis, reducing memory usage
  - Error handling remains in caller's process context
- **Updated Message Protocol**: Changed from `{:rate_ltd_result, id, result}` to `{:rate_ltd_execute, id}`
- **Simplified QueuedRequest**: Removed function storage from request structure
- **Updated Telemetry Events**: 
  - Removed `:request_executed` and `:request_execution_failed`
  - Added `:request_signaled` and `:request_caller_unavailable`

### Added
- **Skema Integration**: All configuration structs now use Skema for validation
  - Built-in validators for min/max values, string length, enums
  - Cleaner schema definitions with declarative field constraints
  - Better error messages with detailed changesets
  - Automatic type casting and validation in one step
- **Enhanced Validation**: More robust input validation across all components

### Benefits
- ðŸš€ **Improved Performance**: No serialization/deserialization of functions
- ðŸ“ˆ **Better Scalability**: No single bottleneck for function execution  
- ðŸ§  **Reduced Memory**: Functions not stored in Redis queues
- ðŸ”§ **Simpler Code**: Less infrastructure for function handling
- âš¡ **Natural Concurrency**: Multiple requests execute in parallel when rate limits allow
- âœ… **Better Validation**: Declarative schema validation with Skema
